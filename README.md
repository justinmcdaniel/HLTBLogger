# HLTBLogger

This app is a HowLongToBeat logger app for posting game session time via a stopwatch-style interface.

Please note, due to HowLongToBeat not having a public API, this application works by scraping their HTML. This means the application could fail to function at any time due to changes beyond the developer's control. Use at your own risk.
